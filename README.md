# GraalVM docker image

Docker image containing the Community Edition of GraalVM with the extra languages enabled. 
Maven 3.6.1 is also added for easy use in projects

This image is completely based on the official oracle/graalvm builds and follows the same versioning system.
It only fixes some settings like GRAALVM_HOME and activates the other languages making it more developer friendly.

## Example(s)

### quarkus:dev
The command below will run `mvn compile quarkus:dev` from
the current folder mapping the local maven repository as a volume
and exposing two ports for easy usage outside the container.

The compiling and running will happen against the GraalVM in the container.

* Quarkus dev mode build

```bash
docker run                    \
  -it                         \
  --rm                        \
  -v "$(pwd):/project"        \
  -v "${HOME}/.m2:/root/.m2"  \
  -p 8080:8080                \
  ivonet/graalvm:1.0.0-rc16   \
  mvn compile quarkus:dev
```

### native-image build

```bash
docker run                    \
  -it                         \
  --rm                        \
  -v "$(pwd):/project"        \
  -v "${HOME}/.m2:/root/.m2"  \
  -p 8080:8080                \
  ivonet/graalvm:1.0.0-rc16   \
  mvn package -Pnative
```

### GraalVM as interactive shell

```bash
docker run                    \
  -it                         \
  --rm                        \
  -v "$(pwd):/project"        \
  -v "${HOME}/.m2:/root/.m2"  \
  -p 8080:8080                \
  ivonet/graalvm:1.0.0-rc16   \
  /bin/sh
```
